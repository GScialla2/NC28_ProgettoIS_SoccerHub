# SoccerHub Homepage 404 Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The web application was returning a 404 error when accessing the root URL instead of displaying the homepage. This was happening because the HomeServlet was trying to forward to JSP files that didn't exist.

## Root Causes
1. **Missing JSP Files**: The HomeServlet was trying to forward to "/WEB-INF/results/HomePage.jsp" and other specialized homepage JSPs (CoachHomePage.jsp, PlayerHomePage.jsp, FanHomePage.jsp) that didn't exist in the project.
2. **URL Mapping Conflict**: The HomeServlet was annotated with @WebServlet("") to handle root URL requests, but the JSP files it was trying to forward to were missing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Missing JSP Files
Created the following JSP files that were referenced in HomeServlet.java but were missing from the project:

- `/WEB-INF/results/HomePage.jsp`: The main homepage for non-authenticated users
- `/WEB-INF/results/coach/CoachHomePage.jsp`: Specialized homepage for coaches
- `/WEB-INF/results/player/PlayerHomePage.jsp`: Specialized homepage for players
- `/WEB-INF/results/fan/FanHomePage.jsp`: Specialized homepage for fans

### 2. Enhanced JSP Content
- Added dynamic content to display matches and tournaments from request attributes
- Created user-specific sections in the specialized homepages
- Added proper navigation links and styling
- Ensured proper handling of null or empty data collections

### 3. Fixed JSP Syntax
- Fixed JSP syntax issues in the PlayerHomePage.jsp and FanHomePage.jsp files
- Used proper JSP expression syntax for conditional rendering
- Ensured proper type casting for collections

## Expected Results
With these changes:

1. When a user accesses the root URL ("/"), the HomeServlet will intercept the request and forward to the appropriate homepage JSP based on the user's authentication status and type.
2. Non-authenticated users will see the general HomePage.jsp with information about matches and tournaments.
3. Authenticated users will see their specialized homepage (CoachHomePage.jsp, PlayerHomePage.jsp, or FanHomePage.jsp) with personalized content.
4. The 404 error should no longer occur when accessing the root URL.

## Verification Steps
1. Start the application server
2. Access the root URL (http://localhost:8080/SoccerHub_war_exploded/)
3. Verify that the homepage is displayed correctly
4. Log in as different user types (coach, player, fan) and verify that the appropriate specialized homepage is displayed

## Additional Notes
- The index.jsp file is still configured as the welcome file in web.xml, but the HomeServlet with @WebServlet("") annotation intercepts requests to the root URL before the welcome file is used.
- If there are still issues with the homepage, check the server logs for any exceptions or errors that might be occurring during the forwarding process.
