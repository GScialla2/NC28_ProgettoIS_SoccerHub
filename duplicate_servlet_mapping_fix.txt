# SoccerHub Duplicate Servlet Mapping Fix

## Issue
The application was failing to deploy in Tomcat with the error:
```
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: The servlets named [InizioServlet] and [Controller.InizioServlet] are both mapped to the url-pattern [/inizio] which is not permitted
```

## Root Cause
The InizioServlet was mapped to the URL pattern "/inizio" in two different ways:
1. Through the `@WebServlet("/inizio")` annotation in the InizioServlet class
2. Through the servlet mapping in web.xml:
   ```xml
   <servlet-mapping>
       <servlet-name>InizioServlet</servlet-name>
       <url-pattern>/inizio</url-pattern>
   </servlet-mapping>
   ```

This created a conflict during deployment because Tomcat saw two different servlet registrations (one from the annotation and one from web.xml) trying to use the same URL pattern.

## Fix Applied
Removed the `@WebServlet("/inizio")` annotation from the InizioServlet class, keeping only the web.xml mapping.

This ensures there's only one servlet mapping for the "/inizio" URL pattern, which resolves the conflict.

## Verification
The application builds successfully after the change. The servlet will continue to be accessible via the "/inizio" URL pattern as defined in web.xml.

## Best Practices
When configuring servlets, it's best to choose one approach consistently:
1. Either use annotations (`@WebServlet`) for all servlets
2. Or use web.xml mappings for all servlets

Mixing both approaches can lead to conflicts if not carefully managed. In this case, we chose to keep the web.xml configuration since it appears to be the primary configuration method used in the project.
