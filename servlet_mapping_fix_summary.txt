# SoccerHub Servlet Mapping Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was returning a 404 error when trying to access the InizioServlet. This was happening because there was a discrepancy between the servlet annotation and the web.xml mapping.

## Root Causes
1. **Conflicting URL Mappings**: The InizioServlet was annotated with `@WebServlet("/InizioServlet")` but mapped to `/inizio` in web.xml.
2. **Inconsistent References**: Some parts of the code were referencing the servlet as "/InizioServlet" while others were using "/inizio".

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated InizioServlet Annotation
Changed the annotation in InizioServlet.java from:
```java
@WebServlet("/InizioServlet")
```

To:
```java
@WebServlet("/inizio")
```

This ensures the annotation matches the mapping in web.xml.

### 2. Updated References in LoginServlet
Updated two redirects in LoginServlet.java that were using the old path:

From:
```java
response.sendRedirect(request.getContextPath() + "/InizioServlet?action=login");
```

To:
```java
response.sendRedirect(request.getContextPath() + "/inizio?action=login");
```

## Verification
- The build completed successfully after making these changes.
- The servlet should now be accessible via the "/inizio" URL pattern, which is consistent with how it's referenced throughout the JSP files.

## Additional Notes
- When both web.xml and @WebServlet annotations are used, there can be conflicts if they specify different URL patterns.
- It's generally better to use one or the other consistently, but if both are used, they must be kept in sync.
- All JSP files in the project were already using the "/inizio" pattern, which indicates this was likely the intended URL pattern.
