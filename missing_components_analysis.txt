# SoccerHub Project - Missing Components Analysis

Based on my analysis of the SoccerHub project, here are the missing components that need to be implemented for the application to function properly:

## 1. Registration JSP Files
Several JSP files referenced in the RegistrazioneServlet are missing:
- /WEB-INF/results/RegisterUser.jsp
- /WEB-INF/results/RegisterCoach.jsp
- /WEB-INF/results/RegisterPlayer.jsp
- /WEB-INF/results/RegisterFan.jsp

## 2. Database Integration Issues
- No connection pooling implementation - each DAO method creates a new connection with hardcoded credentials
- The database credentials (root/password) are hardcoded in DAO classes, which is a security risk
- No mechanism to initialize the database schema on application startup

## 3. DAO Implementation Issues
- UserDAO.doAuthenticate() returns a basic User object, but LoginServlet checks if it's an instance of Coach, Player, or Fan
- UserDAO.doSave() is used to save specialized user types (Coach, Player, Fan) but likely doesn't handle their specific attributes
- No specialized DAO classes for Coach, Player, and Fan to handle their specific attributes

## 4. Authentication and Authorization
- Password hashing uses SHA-1, which is considered weak by modern security standards
- No proper session management or security filters
- No role-based access control

## 5. Frontend Components
- Missing match and tournament detail pages
- Missing match and tournament creation/editing forms

## 6. Business Logic
- Incomplete implementation of tournament management
- Incomplete implementation of match scheduling and results tracking
- No user statistics tracking

## 7. Testing and Validation
- No unit tests for model classes and DAOs
- No integration tests for servlets
- Limited form validation

The application has a good foundation with basic Model classes, DAO implementations, Controller servlets, and a homepage, but requires significant additional development to become fully functional.
