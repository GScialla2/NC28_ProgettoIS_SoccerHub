# SoccerHub Import Fix Summary

## Issue
The application was failing to compile with the error:
"C:\Users\gabry\Universit√†\IS\SoccerHubProgettoIS\Codice\SoccerHub\src\main\java\Controller\UserValidator.java:4:37 java: package java.lang.classfile.attribute does not exist"

## Root Cause
The UserValidator.java file was importing a package that doesn't exist in the current Java environment:
```java
import java.lang.classfile.attribute.RuntimeVisibleAnnotationsAttribute;
```

This package is part of newer Java versions (Java 21+) and provides APIs for working with Java class file attributes. It's used for low-level class file manipulation and isn't typically needed for regular application development.

## Fix Applied
Removed the unnecessary import statement from UserValidator.java since it wasn't being used anywhere in the code.

## Verification
The application now compiles successfully without any errors.

## Additional Notes
- The import was likely added by mistake or was a leftover from code that was later removed.
- The UserValidator class only uses standard Java utilities (Pattern, Map, HashMap, Date) for its validation functionality.
- No replacement import was needed as the functionality wasn't being used.
